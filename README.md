# Collab Backend - Task Coordination

The Collab backend is a fundamental part of the application that enables task management and efficient team coordination. It is developed in C# .NET and uses Entity Framework to interact with a SQL Server database.

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: The Collab backend allows for task creation, updates, and assignment.

- **Secure Database**: We utilize SQL Server to ensure secure and reliable data storage for the application.

- **RESTful API**: The backend exposes a RESTful API for communication with the frontend and other parts of the application.

## Technologies Used

The Collab backend has been developed using the following technologies:

- **C# .NET**: A versatile and powerful programming language used to create application logic.

- **Entity Framework (EF)**: EF is used for object-to-database mapping, simplifying interactions with SQL Server.

- **SQL Server**: A relational database that ensures data integrity and security.

## Configuration and Usage

To run the Collab backend in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the backend repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

3. **Configure the Database**: Set up an instance of SQL Server and update the connection string in the backend's configuration.

4. **Start the Server**: Launch the backend server. You can do this by running the application from your development environment or using tools like Visual Studio.

5. **API Endpoints**: Explore and utilize the API endpoints of the RESTful API to interact with the backend from the frontend or any client.
